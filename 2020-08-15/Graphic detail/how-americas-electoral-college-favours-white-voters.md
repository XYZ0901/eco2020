A  FUNDAMENTAL TEST for any voting system is whether it treats citizens equally. America’s presidential election uses the “electoral college”, which allocates 538 votes based on states’ representation in Congress. A candidate who wins the popular vote in a state is allocated its chunk of electoral-college votes (ECVS)—from just three for Vermont, to 55 for California. Nominees must amass 270 ECVS to win.

This system can lead to unfair outcomes: in two of the past five elections, the winner of the White House (a Republican) did not win the national popular vote. Some cite this as evidence that the system is biased against the Democratic Party. It is more complicated than that.

The Economist used its presidential-election-forecasting model—which simulates the election 20,000 times a day—to quantify the system’s biases. Using each forecast for every state we determined the chance that any given voter in a particular state casts the decisive ballot in November. That figure is the product of two probabilities: whether a single state is likely to edge a candidate over 270 ECVS; and whether that state is won by a single voter.

The odds are shortest in New Hampshire, where the chance that someone casts the decisive vote is around 1-in-10m elections. By contrast, a resident of Washington, DC, will tip the contest only once in a trillion elections. The point is not that these chances are small, but that the gaps between them are large. Our model suggests that a Granite Stater who moves to neighbouring Vermont becomes 1,000 times less likely to affect the result of the election, simply by moving a few miles.

As states have different demographic mixes the electoral college can exaggerate the clout of some voter groups. For example, white people are expected to comprise roughly 73% of an average state’s voters come November. But if the average is weighted instead by how likely a voter in each state is to decide the outcome of the election, the white share of voting power climbs to 79%. That is because the most competitive states are whiter than the national average.

Those whose votes count for less are less likely to bother casting a ballot, it seems. Voters from states that were most likely to decide the election in 2016 were ten percentage points more likely to vote. That suggests that replacing the electoral college might lead to increased turnout.■
