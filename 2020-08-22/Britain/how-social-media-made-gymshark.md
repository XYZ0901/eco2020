# How social media made Gymshark

WHEN RICHARD BRANSON, a serial entrepreneur, was 28, he snapped up a Caribbean island to impress a woman. In London he hobnobbed with rockstars and posed for a photograph in the bath, naked save for a well-positioned copy of the Financial Times. Now the same age, Ben Francis has made more money than the young Mr Branson had. But the Brummie founder of Gymshark, an athletic clothing brand, could hardly be less flamboyant. His black and grey outfit matches his HQ. When he isn’t working, he’s lifting weights, messing around with motorbikes or eating Nando’s. “That’s literally all I do,” he says.“I’m a really boring person.”

But the men share a lucrative knack for capturing the zeitgeist. Mr Francis founded Gymshark from his parents’ garage in 2012, making gym gear his grandmother taught him to sew. On August 14th, General Atlantic, an American fund manager, bought a 21% stake in the firm, in a deal that valued it at more than £1bn ($1.3bn). That transformation makes for a remarkable business story, but it also reveals how quickly gym culture is changing in the rich world.

The brand’s early success owed much to men like Mr Francis. When he first started going to a gym at 16, he found it intimidating. “You have no idea what you’re doing, you think everybody’s looking at you, you feel really self-conscious. Am I doing this bicep curl right?” So he turned to YouTube and online forums for tips. His business milks this merging of physical and online spaces. The 125 influencers Gymshark pays to market its brand on platforms like Instagram are role models as much as fashion models, offering the sort of encouragement Mr Francis once sought. Instagram provides motive as well as means: muscular men in tight-fitting gear attract envy as well as romantic attention.

But Gymshark would not be nearly as valuable if it were not for a second culture shift. That is the trend for “athleisure”, wearing gym gear not just for working out. Though Gymshark initially targeted beefy male weightlifters, women now account for about two-thirds of its sales. And, as Melis Kahya Akar of General Atlantic is quick to point out, they are the bigger spenders. Many women wear Gymshark to lift weights, but plenty favour fit and fashion over performance. Social media allow Gymshark to target distinct demographics simultaneously. A study in 2018 by Linus Juhlin and Miretta Soini, then MBA students in Sweden, explains how it works.

The authors studied the Instagram posts of 30 Gymshark influencers, including such big noises as fitgurlmel, who has 1m followers. Male influencers were more than twice as likely as their female counterparts to pose while working out, but much less likely to stress the fit, colour and design of the gear. “Gym settings were common in the male influencers’ posts,” the authors wrote. In posts by women, poses were more commonly “lifestyle-related”; one wore a sports bra to a basketball game. So Mr Francis can afford to be boring. A tribe of Instagrammers will do the talking—and the selling—for him.■
