Your interesting article on the coming-out experiences of gay people did not mention the widespread institutionalised discrimination they face in eastern Europe (“Queer, there and everywhere”, [August 8th](https://www.economist.com//international/2020/08/08/how-the-internet-is-changing-the-experience-of-coming-out)). In Russia a recent referendum contained a draft amendment banning same-sex marriage. In Poland Andrzej Duda, the president, declared during his re-election campaign in June that gays “are not people” but are worse than Bolshevism, and that gay marriage is out of the question for Poland.

Just days after his swearing-in ceremony, the police used heavy-handed tactics against demonstrators who were protesting against the detention of a gay activist; 48 were arrested. The police claimed the protesters were being disruptive and denied them access to lawyers.

You wrote about a generally more tolerant world for gay people, but there are still places in Europe where discrimination and bigotry are entrenched and where equality before the law does not exist.

“Tolerance” of gay people is progress, but it is not a Utopia of respect, acceptance and celebration of differences. Yes, more of us are coming out, and earlier, but it is still not easy. I don’t want to settle for “gay rights”. I want equal rights. Pride events are visible because they are unusual. For the rest of the year we check our surroundings before holding hands, even in San Francisco or London. Most American states still allow the panic defence, which allows someone to claim temporary insanity if they attack a gay person. And gay sex is still illegal in nearly 70 countries.

I have been out for decades and have grown used to being told that things are fine for us now, and that I should be grateful for other people’s tolerance. I was delighted when you called for equal marriage 24 years ago (“Let them wed”, [January 6th 1996](https://www.economist.com//news/2014/10/10/let-them-wed)). But please consider a place for us gay folks beyond being tolerated.

Your economics brief on competition argued that were “the market less concentrated” for digital advertising, the cost for firms might fall (“From hospitality to hipsterism”, [August 8th](https://www.economist.com//schools-brief/2020/08/08/what-more-should-antitrust-be-doing)). This ignores one of the unique aspects of the business model of the digital-advertising platforms: negative marginal costs. Machine learning, which powers these advertising systems, is famously data hungry. The models that serve ads get better with scale.

These negative marginal costs are a big reason why many believe that breaking up the platforms will ultimately be ineffective. The other dimension of digital advertising is that advertisers get value for showing digital ads that are more relevant in these large-scale systems. I, for one, enjoy seeing ads related to my interest in The Economist on Google and Facebook.

I enjoyed your special report on the Midwest ([July 25th](https://www.economist.com//special-report/2020/07/23/a-region-with-outsized-punch)), though you were dismissive of rural areas. My small hometown in Minnesota is surrounded by the hills and hardwood forests of the unglaciated Driftless Area. A state-of-the-art school opened in 2017. A 60-mile paved bike-trail winds through the limestone bluffs of the Root river valley. The professional Commonweal Theatre Company operates year-round in a neighbouring town. Within an hour’s drive are nine colleges and universities, the Mayo Clinic and Medical School, the Minnesota Beethoven Festival and the Minnesota Marine Art Museum. In Fillmore county, which is nearly the size of Luxembourg but hasn’t a single four-lane road, no one complains about traffic.

Our rural areas have an extraordinarily productive agricultural sector, vibrant small businesses, inexpensive housing, low crime, and a sense of community. Nominal income and GDP per person may lag behind that of our cities, but our quality of life is second to none.

DAVID SCHOBERRushford, Minnesota

Why did you refer to those who live in country areas as “folk” while their city counterparts are “dwellers”? Can you not dwell in the countryside, or is such a word too sophisticated for such folk? Why not go further and call them bumpkins? Alternatively, both could be referred to as people.

Your piece on the eastern Mediterranean was very interesting (“Battling over boundaries”, [August 22nd](https://www.economist.com//international/2020/08/22/a-row-between-turkey-and-greece-over-gas-is-raising-tension-in-the-eastern-mediterranean)). But you didn’t mention Britain, apart from the briefest reference to British support for Kurdish fighters. Britain has traditionally played a historic role in eastern Mediterranean affairs, and has strategically important Sovereign Base Areas in Cyprus. Could one have a more eloquent commentary on Britain’s decline in international relevance, presumably fuelled by Brexit? We don’t even rate a mention.

SIR DAVID MADDENOxford

Turkey’s situation is particularly tragic, as it actually has a good case for getting Greece’s exclusive economic zones (EEZ) reduced. If only it pursued legal channels in good faith. Virtually all island disputes that have been brought to international arbitration, from St Pierre and Miquelon by Newfoundland, to the Kerkennah Islands by Libya, have resulted in smaller EEZs for islands that are far from a country’s mainland.

Kastellorizo in particular, would seem to have little claim to an EEZ. It is only a mile off the coast of Turkey and nearly 100 miles east of Rhodes, with only a few hundred residents, and virtually no economy. The tragedy though, is that no one can take Turkey seriously when it instead thunders about its “blue homeland” and signs agreements with Libya that pretend Crete and Rhodes are no different from Kastellorizo.

I was surprised that you did not include the contribution of John Snow in your perspective on pandemics and economic expansion (“Cleanliness is next to growth”, [August 1st](https://www.economist.com//books-and-arts/2020/08/01/how-hand-washing-explains-economic-expansion)). Snow established that cholera is a water-borne disease, laying the groundwork for the science of epidemiology. Like many public-health professionals, I made a pilgrimage to the site of the Broad Street Pump in London’s Soho, which Snow identified as the source of a cholera outbreak, and stopped at the John Snow pub.

Andrew Adonis rightly criticised you for mocking the idea of Parliament relocating to York (Letters, [August 22nd](https://www.economist.com//letters/2020/08/22/letters-to-the-editor)). In 1963 you argued that “nobody really believes” in Britain’s local democracy (“Federal Britain’s new frontiers”, [May 18th 1963](https://www.economist.com/https://docs.google.com/gview?embedded=true&url=https://media.economist.com/sites/default/files/pdfs/editorial_links/York_Parliament.pdf)). That is as true today as it was then. At the time you called for the creation of a federal Britain to be organised by regions, with its capital, Elizabetha, located near that northern city.
