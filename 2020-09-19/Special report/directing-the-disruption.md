> Companies that fail to tackle climate change face a backlash

> Sep 17th 2020

THE PRINCIPAL message of this special report is that companies everywhere urgently need to step up their action against climate change. Its physical impact is already causing many of them serious damage. Pushed by voters, especially younger ones, governments around the world are introducing ever tougher regulations. Lawsuits could yet make firms’ lives harder still. And, although new technology can be expected to help with the problem in time, it will not do enough on its own to meet the enormous challenge of climate change.

One place to start is with better carbon-emissions data. Today few companies even know how much greenhouse-gases suppliers belch out. That means they will struggle to calculate the full environmental impact of their products. Where data do exist, they are often self-reported, inconsistent or too out of date to be useful. But work is under way to fix this.

Along with some other firms, Microsoft plans to launch an emissions reporting standard for suppliers later this year, backed up by sustainability audits. “Science tells us where we need to be, but the data tell us where we are now,” says Brad Smith, Microsoft’s president. In January the Rocky Mountain Institute and other research groups started to standardise greenhouse-gas metrics for mining and industrial supply chains. With help from Google, WattTime and CarbonTracker, two lobby groups, are estimating emissions from coal-fired power plants in real time using satellite imagery and whizzy algorithms.

The hope is that better numbers could unleash market forces and consumer choice. Carbon labels, much like food labels, could guide consumers towards greener products, giving firms yet another incentive to decarbonise. However, there are also reasons to be sceptical about the effect of such direct action. Many previous carbon-labelling schemes have failed to gain traction. Persuading firms to adopt them is hard. And consumers are confused by the dizzying array: Ecolabel Index, a green-label directory, counts 457 such labels.

In any case, consumer action on its own can do only so much. One study, led by Daniel Moran of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, examined the effect on Europe’s carbon footprint of 90 behavioural changes, such as buying low-carbon products and eating less meat. Researchers found that the maximum reduction was 24%. That is an important chunk, but not enough to defeat global warming. The conclusion is that policymakers are needed even more than consumers to push companies towards serious decarbonisation.

Electorates can, however, make a big difference. If hordes of green voters start turning up at polling stations, they could accelerate the trends set out in this report. They will press political leaders to impose more environmentally friendly regulations and laws. And when the younger generation starts to save and invest, it could press financial firms to back green companies faster than many expect. A recent report by BlackRock estimates that, by around 2035, the wealth held by American millennials (those who were born between 1981 and 1997) will exceed that of baby boomers (born between 1946 and 1964).

This only strengthens the case for every firm to do more now to tackle climate change. The underlying reason for early action lies in two inescapable facts. The world of commerce is deeply interconnected because of international trade. And climate change is a systemic problem. Greenhouse gases are emitted by every firm in the world, either through its own operations or in its supply chain. Its effects will hit every firm directly or indirectly. For different companies this will translate into different costs. But none will be entirely untouched.

Energy transitions are slow, so firms need to act soon. For those business sectors in which mitigation is hardest, such as steel or shipping, coming up with a viable, low-carbon alternative could take many years. Moreover, some carbon-producing assets last a long time. A steel mill built today will probably be pumping out CO2 in 20 years’ time. If companies are to decarbonise by midcentury, many newly built assets will need to be carbon-free by the end of the present decade.

And there is another, more enticing reason to move swiftly. Decarbonising the economy holds many risks but it also offers plenty of opportunities. They lie in developing new technology, becoming more carbon efficient than competitors or selling genuinely green products to consumers. Firms that get ahead of their rivals and seize such opportunities will reap the biggest benefits. They may just help save the planet as well.■
